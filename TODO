There's something incompatible with Adobe Bridge, where it can't
rotate any of the files after this script updates the EXIF data.

exif module seems to butcher the following:
Bad InteropIFD directory
---- ExifIFD ----
Components Configuration        : Err (25), Cb, Cr, -

At least these were found in exiftool.
I filed an issue with the exif library:

Also test on TIF files to make sure they behave properly.

Add README with instructions for setting up EZC to output in the right
format for this script to work on.
